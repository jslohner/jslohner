### Hello There ðŸ‘‹

About Me
- My name is Justin Lohner, I am 25 years old, I live in Utah, and I am a Software Engineer.
- I'm currently working as an AI Data Trainer, at DataAnnotation.
- I've most recently worked as a Web Developer at JaroDesk, an appraisal management software company, for a about 3 1/2 years.

- I was originally hired solely as a Back-End developer, but I've been able to learn a ton about both Back-End development and Front-End development.
- As a Back-End developer, I held the position of the technical lead over integrations for about 9 months, but due to our team size shrinking to 5 developers (including our dev team manager), I transitioned into Full-Stack because that is what our team has needed.
- I have built many different integrations, with many different appraisal management software companies, allowing our software to communicate with those integrations.
- I've also worked on many other types of integrations as well, such as converting PDF files to Appraisal ENV files and more notably, I've built an integration with TopBloc/Workday, involving accounting and payment management.
- I have been able to gain a lot of experience with PHP and specifically, the Laravel Framework.
- I have also worked with many Laravel/PHP packages such as: barryvdh/laravel-dompdf, maatwebsite/excel, phpunit, pestphp, aws/aws-sdk-php, and baopham/dynamodb.
- I also have frontend experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js
- I have also gained a good amount of experience with the DevOps lifecycle using and learning about steps such as planning, building, testing, and monitoring.
- At this point, I am confident in my ability to learn new things relatively quickly and efficiently, although I know that I want to continue to develop this skill throughout my entire career.
- I am a graduate of BloomTech Institue of Technology (formerly known as Lambda School).
- I am passionate about problem-solving and programming.
- I love to focusing on how I can solve problems more efficiently and effectively and I love focusing on optimization and scalability.
- My favorite thing about being a developer is that I get to learn new things every day and that there will always be more I can learn and there will always be more ways that I can grow as a developer!
